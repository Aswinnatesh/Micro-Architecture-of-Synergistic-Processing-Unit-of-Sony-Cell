## Micro Architecture of Synergistic Processing Unit of Sony Cell

This repository contains my graguate coursework project for ESE 545 Computer Architecture.

Designing a SONY Cell Processor Architecture (SPU) that includes the detection of structural, data and control hazards. Involves behavioral modeling at RTL level using Verilog to simulate the instruction flow in the pipelined processor.
